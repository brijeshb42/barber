        <li>For ex, to just upload an image from anywhere to our own server, just input the image image URL, click on <b>Free</b> button and resize the crop area to fit the entire image and then click <b>Save</b>.</li>
        <li>If you want the free size selection to resize to a particular width, just enter the desired width into the <b>Resize Width</b> input. Height is automatically calculated based on the aspect ratio of the selected area.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>After selecting image</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When you click on a predefined size button, the crop area appears. Move it around or resize the area to get your desired region of image.</li>
        <li>Select other size regions.</li>
        <li>After completing the selection, confirm the sizes you want to save by checking the relevant boxes.</li>
        <li>Now click on <b>Save</b> and wait. Image manipulation is a time taking operation.</li>
